# Sentiment-Driven-Bitcoin-Detectives

This project utilizes deep learning, specifically LSTM and NLP for sentiment analysis
to analyze Bitcoin price with Bitcoin tweets, and Macroeconomics indexes such as S&P 500
index and USD INDEX. The primary goal is to leverage sentiment analysis and LSTM
techniques to uncover patterns in the cryptocurrency market, particularly about Bitcoin price
movements, which can provide financial insights and effective decision-making. By
incorporating multiple data sources and leveraging deep learning techniques, the outcome of
the project will provide valuable insights into the interplay between social media sentiment,
financial indicators, and Bitcoin price dynamics, while showcasing the efficacy of deep
learning models for time series analysis in the cryptocurrency domain.
